author_bio: DataCamp is a young team of data analytics enthusiasts that provide affordable interactive data science and statistics education to the world. We do not believe in an educational framework that centers on passively reading books, or on watching YouTube videos that put a focus on the instructor, and not the scholar. We provide courses for both the novice and the experienced data scientist, and even allow passionate users to freely use the learning platform to create their own interactive courses.<br><br>
